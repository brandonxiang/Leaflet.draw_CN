# Leaflet.draw_CN
A Chinese translation for Leaflet.draw

##Demo

[Demo](http://brandonxiang.github.io/Leaflet.draw_CN)


##Idea

This repo is inspired by [developerworks/leaflet-longfor](https://github.com/developerworks/leaflet-longfor). Because [Leaflet.draw](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.draw) has no translation function yet, it is popular to use it in China. It is not simple to add a customized localization

Therefore, I determined to write a new translation file for `Leaflet.draw` Version 0.3.0.

##Usage

```
    <script src="localization/zh_cn.js"></script>
```

To replace the English version of `L.drawLocal`
